\chapter{Epoch Boundary Blocks}
\label{ebbs}

Discuss that although EBBs are a Byron concern, their presence has far reaching
consequences on the consensus later. In hindsight, we should have tried harder
to not deal with them at all from the beginning; we did not anticipate quite how
bad the situation would be. We now have a plan for getting rid of them
(\cref{decontamination-plan}) but it will be a fairly long term thing and it
might not happen at all, depending on quite how much time is available for
removing tech debt.
